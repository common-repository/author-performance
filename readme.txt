== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is widget included? =

No. I'll include the widget in forthcoming versions.

= Why couldnt I use a single function call to output data?

Flexibility. I dont want to limit users to some predefined context, like using <li> tags. I also included data on how to use the function in pages, etc.
